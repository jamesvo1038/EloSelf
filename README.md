# E-L-O-Q-U-E-N-T 

This is my journey in studying Javascript from Eloquent Book and it consists my solution for all of the exercises.

The goal is to learn JS in modern ways.

## FUNCTION
- Are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming.
- THe concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses.
- Give us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names w/ subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.

## Defining a function

A function definition: 
1. A regular binding where the valueof the bindin is a function.
2.  Function is created w/ an expression that starts w/ the keyword **_function_**.
3. The function body of a function created this way must always be wrapped by braces **{}**.
